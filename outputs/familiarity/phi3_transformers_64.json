    "text": "### Example 1:\nQuestion: What is the missing number: 3, 7, 15, 31, ? Options: (A) 55 (B) 63\nReasoning: Looking at the pattern: 3×2+1=7, 7×2+1=15, 15×2+1=31. Each number is double the previous plus one. So 31×2+1=63.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: Do birds have teeth? Options: (A) No (B) Yes\nReasoning: Modern birds do not have teeth. They have beaks instead. However, fossil evidence shows that ancient birds did have teeth. Birds lost their teeth during evolution, likely to reduce weight for flight and because beaks are more efficient for their feeding strategies.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: Where do you put your head when you sleep? Options: (A) On a pillow (B) On a chair\nReasoning: When sleeping, you typically put your head on a pillow for comfort and support.

Options: (A) On a pillow (B) On a table\nReasoning: When sleeping, you typically put your head on a pillow for comfort and support. Pillows are specifically designed for this purpose and help maintain proper neck alignment while sleeping. Other objects would be uncomfortable or impractical.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: If a train travels 60 mph for 2 hours, how far does it go?

When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more than other colors, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: Can fish survive on land? Options: (A) No (B) Yes\nReasoning: Most fish cannot survive on land because they have gills adapted for extracting oxygen from water, not air. However, there are some exceptions like mudskippers and lungfish that can breathe air and survive out of water for limited periods.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?

This has been confirmed through space observations, satellite imagery, and various scientific measurements.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: What is the smallest unit of matter? Options: (A) Electron (B) Atom\nReasoning: The atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. While atoms contain smaller particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons, these subatomic particles don't maintain the chemical properties of the element on their own.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: If today is Wednesday, what day will it be 10 days from now?

From a physics perspective, 'wetness' refers to a liquid's ability to adhere to a solid surface. Water can make other things wet, but whether water itself is 'wet' depends on the definition used.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: What happens when you drop a ball? Options: (A) It grows bigger (B) It falls down\nReasoning: When you drop a ball, gravity pulls it toward the Earth's surface, so it falls down. This is a basic principle of physics - objects are attracted to Earth by gravitational force unless acted upon by another force.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: Do humans have tails? Options: (A) Yes (B) No\nReasoning: Adult humans do not have external tails. While human embryos develop a tail during early development, it typically disappears before birth. Very rarely, some humans are born with a small tail-like structure, but this is an abnormality, not the norm.\nAnswer: B\n\n### New Question:\nQuestion: What happens to ice when it gets warm?

A car is stored in a garage, making this the most appropriate relationship.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: Is the Earth round? Options: (A) Yes (B) No\nReasoning: Yes, the Earth is approximately round (spherical). While it's not a perfect sphere due to its rotation causing slight flattening at the poles, it is fundamentally round. This has been confirmed through space observations, satellite imagery, and various scientific measurements.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: What is the largest mammal in the world?

While it's not a perfect sphere due to its rotation causing slight flattening at the poles, it is fundamentally round. This has been confirmed through space observations, satellite imagery, and various scientific measurements.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion: What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ? Options: (A) 24 (B) 32\nReasoning: Looking at the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, I can see that each number is double the previous one: 2×2=4, 4×2=8, 8×2=16. So the next number should be 16×2=32.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: What is the largest mammal in the world?

Options: (A) Electron (B) Atom\nReasoning: The atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. While atoms contain smaller particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons, these subatomic particles don't maintain the chemical properties of the element on their own.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Example 3:\nQuestion: Do trees produce oxygen? Options: (A) Yes (B) No\nReasoning: Yes, trees produce oxygen through photosynthesis. They absorb carbon dioxide and water, and using sunlight and chlorophyll, they convert these into glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process is crucial for maintaining atmospheric oxygen levels.\nAnswer: A\n\n### New Question:\nQuestion: Is the Earth round? Options: (A) Yes (B) No"
